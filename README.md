### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a student at University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, and passionate coder. I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies and tools to improve my skills.


### ğŸ’» What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on my own project, which is creating a website for band. I'm excited about this project because it will help me develop as a front-end developer and learn more about things like React.


### ğŸŒ± What I'm Learning

I'm always eager to learn new things, and lately, I've been focusing on web development.
